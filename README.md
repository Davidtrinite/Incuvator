# Incuvator

Students are struggling to find a job due to the lack of experience and skills right out of college. So we created a club to learn how to network with individuals in the tech and develop projects and skills they can include on their resumes.

D Incuvator! We are an incubator for innovators. We hope to equip people with the creative and critical aptitude to break in to tech. We hope to be apart of students development and growth journeys by connecting them with investors, advisors, mentors and other key players in the startup and tech ecosystem across the world.

To do this we want to offer educational, social and networking activities for students. Activities include seminars by faculty and guest speakers, workshops on networking and new software development framework, and projects they can include on their resumes
